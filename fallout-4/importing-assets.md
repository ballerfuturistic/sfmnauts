## Importing assets

1. Install [**Niftools.**](/fallout-4/tools.md)
2. Once you get to the dialog which requests your extracted directories, **ensure that you select the root directy of the folder it's asking you for** -- i.e. 

`D:\Porting\Fallout\BASE\`

**NOT**

`D:\Porting\Fallout\BASE\Meshes`

I know, strange, right?

After that, it's a pretty straightforward process.

1. **File -&gt; Import** and select the **.nif** you'd like to import.
