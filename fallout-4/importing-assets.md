## Importing assets

1. Install **[Niftools.](/fallout-4/tools.md)**
2. Once you get to the dialog which requests your extracted directories, **ensure that you select the root directy of the folder it's asking you for** -- i.e. 

`D:\Porting\Fallout\BASE\`

**NOT**

`D:\Porting\Fallout\BASE\Meshes`

I know, strange, right?

After that, it's a pretty straightforward process.

3. **File -> Import** and select the **.nif** you'd like to import.
