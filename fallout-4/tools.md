Fallout 4 Animation kit has many tutorials itself, mainly, we'll be using the tool in it called "HKXPackGUI" This will be found in the "tools" folder of the animations kit.
Note: When you run HKXPackGUI.exe, you'll get an error. Don't worry, this is normal. Hit okay and continue as usual

**Havoc Content Toolkit 2014 64-Bit**

We can't really host this one on the site, honestly, or we'd be insta-taken down. If you have any questions as to where you **might** be able to get it, shoot us a DM on Discord.
