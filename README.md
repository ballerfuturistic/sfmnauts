# Introduction

SFM is a great program with a great community around it focused around models ported from different games in order to make various fanmade content.

The reality is, albeit SFM itself is pretty popular, model porting is a small community and indefinitely a **niche** in the grand scheme of things. It's an **even smaller niche** when you only consider people who release "good ports."

There are those who take it a step further and contribute time out of their day in order to provide more content to the community for use, which I'm extremely thankful for. However, honestly, the information is a bit hard to come by or completely kept under wraps -- most of what people **are** able to come by is usually kept on threads or post replies. This is partially because I believe there's no real documentation to these things. This is why I propose the SFMNauts project.

In order to expand our niche with newcomers, and in order provide help and documentation for people interested, or even those already experienced porting content -- I believe information should be easy to access.

Not only does this information being easy to access aid the community -- it also aids content creators, whether it be learning new methods or simply reducing the sheer amount of begging or having to answer the amount of questions over messages because someone is wondering **how something was done.** Not only that, but it simply helps the **content** by keeping it **consistent.**

Why not simply publish the information somewhere where all may access it?

This isn't solely even for the existing SFM community, but even for those who you may have never met or heard of -- looking to get their favorite model from a game -- whether it be a mailbox, or a player character.

Many will be contributing to this wiki in an effort to lessen this dilemma, mostly focusing on PBR -&gt; Source texture conversation, but will write full write ups on how to port from beginning to end on some of these.

## This wiki will always be free and open. It will NEVER EVER take money for the methods provided here. It will never have a Patreon. It will never lock content behind some requirements. It has a completely open Github available with all the information where you can contribute and read over it.

This is, of course, **going to assume that you have general knowledge of Photoshop and some experience working with models.**

**It's not geared toward dumbies.**

There may be times where you might laugh and scoff and say "There's a better way to do this!" **and I openly invite you to PLEASE contribute.** The reality is these are methods that are being added that I have been taught to the best of my ability or with the limited time I was able to spend on them with whoever taught them **in order to come up with at least average results.**

## Contributing

If you'd like to **contribute** just check out the [Github Page](https://github.com/ballerfuturistic/sfmnauts) and make a **fork.** You can do this as long as you're **signed in.** Click the **fork button** on this Githubs **main page.**

After you've made the **fork,** simply edit the files to your hearts content -- **don't worry, it won't affect this master branch at all.**

You edit the files by hitting **"new file."**

If you add a **/** at the end of a **new file name** it'll make a folder. 
Whatever directory you hit **new file** in is where the file will be created, along with any subdirectories you make -- so be careful.

Afterwords, go back to **your own Github page** and hit **New Pull Request.**

The rest should be self explanatory and you'll have **submit it for review.**

**If you want to contribute, please make sure you're using Gitbook's syntax of Markdown language.**

If there's any issues, either [DM ](https://twitter.com/ballerfuturistc)me or message me on Discord &gt; **Mars\#1305**

**yes, you need to include the capital M, i think.**

**It would be good to touch base about what you're going to commit** before adding it due to the nature off these things, **but not neccessary.** I'll read over it.

## Credits

**None of this** would be possible without the help of these people:

* **Blueflytrap**
* **Sundownsyndrome**
* **Kuroyasviel** [\[1\]](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Memeyasviel)

As in, literately, I don't think anyone else would have figured this out -- it's crazy the amount of work and effort they've put into this and I ask that you respect their wishes and work.

* [me, i guess.](https://twitter.com/ballerfuturistc)

You shouldn't really ask  me about these things -- I'm just documenting them. along with the people on Github. Questions are better directed to the contributors relative to their game or anyone listed in the credits. In other words, I don't know much about this texture work.

## Disclaimer

Everything is subject to change based on if the methods change.

I do not claim to know what I am doing. I am merely spreading the information after testing if it works.

I'm going off the basis that some information is better than none, so some things might be incomplete or lack the information you want. I'll try to mark them appropriately.

As stated before, this wiki will always be **free and open.** It will **NEVER EVER** take money for the methods provided here. **It will never have a Patreon.** It will **never** lock content behind paywalls or any other sort of requirement. It has a **completely open Github available with all the information where you can contribute and read over it.**
